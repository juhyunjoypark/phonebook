Goal of the program: I implemented a phonebook system by using Java Language. As dividing properties of people to be stored in the phonebook into general, university, and company, requried data of each person is extracted and allocated as class field values. By using Serialization, instance is configured to be stored and loaded such that the data can be continuously used even after the program is exited. In addition, by using GUI in consideration of User Interface, Interface is implemented to search and delete stored data. The data is dynamically managed by using HashSEt of collection objects, wherein common objects are extracted to form encapsulation and inheritance, and overriding is used such that the objects are operated in different ways for the same action.
